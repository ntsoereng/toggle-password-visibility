# toggle-password-visibility
Toggle the visibility of a password input by using **plain JavaScript**.

A password field provides a way for users to securely input a password 
by showing the * character instead of the actual password characters.  

But, it is possible that some users will type the wrong password.  
To help them see the password as they're currently typing, 
you can add a button that allows them to toggle the visibility of the password.
